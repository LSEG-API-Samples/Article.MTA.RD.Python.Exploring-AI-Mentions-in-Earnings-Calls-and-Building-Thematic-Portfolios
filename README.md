## Exploring AI Mentions in Earnings Calls and Building Thematic Portfolios

### Authors: Haykaz Aramyan, Tiago Quevedo Teodoro

This article examines how the frequency and sentiment of AI mentions in earnings calls have evolved over time and whether these patterns can indicate a company's long-term growth potential. To uncover these insights, we conducted an exploratory analysis of earnings call transcripts from companies across diverse sectors leveraging [LSEG MarketPsych Transcripts Analytics (MTA)](https://www.marketpsych.com/transcripts/guide/overview) API. Additionally, we developed thematic portfolios based on these insights and tracked their historical performance to assess whether investing in AI-focused companies can yield significant returns.

The article is structured into three sections: setting up the dataset, conducting exploratory analysis, and building thematic portfolios.
